Hi Alex.
I'm a senior full-stack developer Norayr from Armenia.
Nice to meet you.
I have experiences in Python and Django.
As for python, I have been working on it for more than 4+ years. As you may know, there are many applications based on Python such as pyqt, pycv, and deep learning. I have a lot of experience in these fields.
Nowadays, Python is also applied to Web development. 
My major skills for web projects are Blockchain, Django, Flask, and Web scrapping.
The most important things I am focused on are credit and integrity. I think we would have a wonderful experience with a good impression and relationship. I am sure I am the person who you are looking for.
I hope we could have a chat as soon as possible. 
I want to know your idea in more detail.
Best regards.
